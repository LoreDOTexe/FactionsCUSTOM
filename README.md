# FactionsCUSTOM [NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE / UNFINISHED]

## What is FactionsCUSTOM?
FactionsCUSTOM is a factions plugin, with a UI, but that's not all. You can customize everything from the command alias to the help messages to enabling and disabling certain subcommands. Maybe you want to change how the top factions are calculated! No problem, this plugin has your back!

### What are the main features?

- Change Main Command Name -- (Does the term "guilds" fit your RPG server more than the term "factions"?)

- Both Faction STR (Kills) and Faction Value (Money) -- (Faction Value requires players to have an economy plugin present.)

- Outposts -- (Outposts have configurable commands for a configuable interval.)

- All Basic Commands -- (/f create, /f invite, /f rename, /f disband, /f kick, /f bank, etc...)

- Faction Upgrades -- (Upgrade points per kill, money multipliers, etc with faction money!)

- Aliies -- (Amount of allies can be configured.)

- Claims  -- (Claims have custom requirements. Want a maximum amount of players, value, or str in order to claim? We've got you! Claim blacklists so nobody can claim certain areas!)

- Invite GUI -- (Players can manage all of their invites!)

- Edit All Messages -- (All messages, save for the version messages, are editable.)

- ALL IN UI FORM!
